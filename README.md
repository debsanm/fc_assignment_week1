# Week 1 Assignment

## Assignment 1
Write a program that uses the console to get the height and width of a rectangle from the user. Then, it calculates the area of rectangle and displays the results.

### Input
height and width

### Output
Area of the rectangle is: <<area_calculateed>>

## Assignment 2
Many treadmills output the speed of the treadmill in miles per hour (mph) on the console, but most runners think of speed in terms of a pace. A common pace is expressed in minutes and seconds per mile, rather than miles per hour (mph). Write a program that starts with a quantity in mph and converts the quantity into minutes and seconds per mile. As an example, the proper output for an input of 6.5 mph should be 9 minutes and 13.8 seconds per mile. If you need to convert a double to an int, which will discard any value after the decimal point, then you may use

```
intValue = static_cast<int>(dblVal);
```
